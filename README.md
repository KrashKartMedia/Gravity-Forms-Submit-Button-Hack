Gravity Forms Submit Button Hack
This is a very simple way to change the submit button text of a gravity form. It's also the same thing as changing the text in the actual form iteself.

Upload this to wp-content/plugins or Install the .zip file by going to Plugins>Add New>Upload Plugin


Once the plugin is activated, head over to WP-Admin>GForms Submit Button Hack. 
Follow The Instructions there. Simple as that! 


##Option 1
The first option will ask you you the gravity form ID#. Say you want to change the submit button text on gravity form ID#5. The first option value should look like gform_submit_button_5.

##Option 2
Just enter in the new submit button text.

#Notice
If you change the form id# from _1 to _2, _1 will reset to the default submit button text
